	<p>TechAPedia is like The Verge, CNET, or PCMAG. It was created by a new web designer called "AnimaTed" He didn't really know what he was doing. He wanted to have an account system but... He didn't have the infostructure or resources to do so. Ok, I'll stop talking like a narrator. Hi. I'm AnimaTed. I learned a bit of HTML from classes on the matter and learned how to code a bit of html I made another website which doesn't do anything. But I learned how to create websites. I'll link it here. scamstore.surge.sh . anyway, I wanted to make a forum page so people can ask for help on problems but I ended up not being able to do so in the timeframe I wanted to be able to develop this website in.Now this is important, so Listen Clearly, THE ADMIN ACCOUNT IS FOR ME TO MODERATE WHAT IS GOING UP ON THE SITE!!!! YOU CAN AND WILL NOT GAIN ACSESS TO THE ACCOUNT NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE, COPY AND PASTE THIS ARTICLE AS "RULES AND REGULATIONS", IF IT CONTINUES I WILL STEP IN. Make sure you were listening. I am hoping to make a new feature where That forum thing happens later on.</p>
