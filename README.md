# Article-Website
I like reading news on The Verge, CNET, And PC MAG so I decided I wanted to make my own. *Name of the site is not Final*. I am new to HTML and I wanted to make 1 Admin account to Manage and Upload Stories. But I wasn't able to manage to do so. I am very new to HTML so if my ways are inefficient, That is why. I ended up Scrapping the idea, but if anyone wants to take a crack at it, I am happy for you to do so. Anyway I need help with this, so if anyone can help, The coding languages I am using are HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. If you want to help, I am happy to let you commit. :) I also want to mention, m.index.html is my try at a mobile version of the site Using Bootstrap. I don't know what to do with that at this point. Bye :)
please do not  finish the code and upload it yourself without properly citing me for the parts of the code I DID make 
if you know how to make this work, and are interested in making it happen. You can get in touch with me on Discord @AnimaTed#6422, and Reddit @AnimaTed6422
If you know someone who could help me. I would greatly suggest giving them the link to this repsitory
Finally, if you don't know how to use HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but want to help, the best way to do so is to spread the word.
