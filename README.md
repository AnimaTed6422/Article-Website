Sporting a major update after months of development.
Coming Online Around June to August
</p>

<p align="center">Current Stage in Development:<br><b>DataBase Setup</b></p>

<h2 align="center">What Happened?</h2>
<p align="center">In Short, I didn't have much time. Other things needed my attention more. Nothing serious, I just had less on my hands, and I got some time again, and made a lot of progress. I'm beta testing the site.</p>
<h4 align="center">What's the Update about?</h4>
<p align="center">Basically, I overhauled the UI, and I'm rewriting some of the systems powering the site.<br>Mainly, my work now is made up of clicking around, adding or changing CSS (I use plain CSS3, no Sass), and editing a bunch of JS. There is one new story as of March 26th, I'm more working on functionality than content. Speaking of Functionality, The current mechanism for opening stories is clunky and bulkier than it needs to be. I'm working on a system for storing stories efficiently (Firebase)</p>
